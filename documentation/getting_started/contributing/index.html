              <ul>
                <li>All active development is in the <code>dev</code> branch. New or updated features must be added to the <code>dev</code> branch. Hotfixes will be considered on the <code>master</code> branch in situations where it does not alter behaviour or features, only fixes a bug.</li>
                <li>All patches must be provided under the Apache 2.0 License</li>
                <li>Please use the -s option in git to "sign off" that the commit is your work and you are providing it under the Apache 2.0 License</li>
                <li>Submit a Github Pull Request to the appropriate branch and ideally discuss the changes with us in IRC.</li>
                <li>We will look at the patch, test it out, and give you feedback.</li>
                <li>Avoid doing minor whitespace changes, renamings, etc. along with merged content. These will be done by the maintainers from time to time but they can complicate merges and should be done seperately.</li>
                <li>Take care to maintain the existing coding style.</li>
                <li><code>golint</code> and <code>go fmt</code> your code.</li>
                <li>Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality.</li>
                <li>All pull requests should be "fast forward"
                  <ul>
                    <li>If there are commits after yours use “git rebase -i <new_head_branch>”</new_head_branch></li>
                    <li>If you have local changes you may need to use “git stash”</li>
                    <li>For git help see <a href="http://git-scm.com/book">progit</a> which is an awesome (and free) book on git</li>

                <li>(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I

              in the file; or</li>
                <li>(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
              of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license
              and I have the right under that license to submit that work with
              modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the
              same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a
              different license), as indicated in the file; or</li>
                <li>(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
              person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.</li>

              <h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>
              
              <p>This Code of Conduct is adapted from <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html">Rust's wonderful
              CoC</a>.</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
              environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
              disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic.</li>
                <li>Please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that
              might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
              all.</li>
                <li>Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.</li>
                <li>Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every
              design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous
              costs. There is seldom a right answer.</li>
                <li>Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid
              ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.</li>
                <li>We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass
              anyone.  That is not welcome behaviour. We interpret the term
              "harassment" as including the definition in the <a href="http://citizencodeofconduct.org/">Citizen Code of
              Conduct</a>; if you have any lack of
              clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read
              their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that
              excludes people in socially marginalized groups.</li>
                <li>Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if
              you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable
              by a community member, please contact one of the channel ops or any
              of the TC members immediately with a capture (log, photo, email) of
              the harassment if possible.  Whether you're a regular contributor or
              a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you
              and we've got your back.</li>
                <li>Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other
              attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.</li>
                <li>Avoid the use of personal pronouns in code comments or
              documentation. There is no need to address persons when explaining
              code (e.g. "When the developer")</li>
