  %p  We now have precompiled binaries! You can also build from source.
  %p  The Gort CLI provides many useful features on many hardware platforms, and has no other dependencies. You install Gort separately from any framework, which means you can use it to program Arduinos with the Firmata firmware also compatible with Cylon.js, Gobot, Artoo, & Johnny-Five.

  %h2 Building
  .description
    %p You need to have installed go-bindata to build the file assets into Gort for a single standalone executable:
    :markdown
          go get github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/...
    %p Once installed, you build the assets into the project like this:
    :markdown
          cd commands && go-bindata -pkg="commands" support/... && cd ..
